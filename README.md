# Knapsack-and-3SAT-algorithms
This project includes the programs for seven different algorithms to solve or find the maximum solution for Knapsack and 3SAT problems.

This project includes the programs for seven different algorithms to solve or find the maximum
solution for Knapsack and 3SAT problems. The codes are divided into two java classes, one
named “Knapsack.java”, the other one named “SAT.java”. In SAT class, the input is in the form
of integer numbers, while the negative sign represents the negation. There is also a bean class
“Clause.java” to be used in the SAT class. Each main class contains codes for testing the running
time and quality based on randomly generated numbers.
